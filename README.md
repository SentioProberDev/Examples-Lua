# Lua examples no longer maintained

this repository is now archived. We will no longer maintain the lua examples because they have been superseeded by the [python archive](https://github.com/SentioProberDev/Examples-Python). Most of the scripts published here will still work with current versions of SENTIO.

# Lua examples for controlling MPI SENTIO probe stations
Lua bindings for controlling a SENTIO probe station. The examples located here can help you to write scripts which control a MPI SENTIO probe station with the Lua programming language.

To use the lua samples download the archive and open the SentioProberLua folder with a Lua IDE, such as [zerobrane](https://studio.zerobrane.com/)
